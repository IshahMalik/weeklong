 <p>Everyone should know these<strong>10 important</strong> things before traveling 
 <br>Whether you are going to the beach for a weekend or traveling abroad for a month 
<br>it’s easy to feel overwhelmed with all the tasks that need to be done.        
<br>To help alleviate a lot of stress and last-minute running around, we created this handy pre-travel
<br>checklist.</p>
        
        <h3>Here are the 10 things you should do BEFORE you travel:</h3></p>
<ol>
<li><h2>CHECKING THE DOCUMENTS</h2></li>

<p> Make sure that you have your all important documents like <strong>(passport/ID card,etc) </strong>
    <br>.And also make sure to have atleast two copies of your passport. Its better if you lose your passport, at least you have a copy.   </P>
<li><h2>PRE-BOOK ONE NIGHT’S ACCOMODATION</h2></li>

<p>Depending on what type of traveler you are — adventurous and spontaneous or carefully planned and structured — <br>we recommend you have at least one night’s accommodation booked in advance.
<br>If you arrive at a new destination and don’t have a place to stay you, you’ll eventually find a spot…but not without some stress involved. </p>
<li><h2>DOUBLE CHECK THE DATES FOR YOUR RESERVATIONS</h2></li>

<P>Of course you should make sure the dates and airports are correct, but it’s equally important to double check that 
    <br> the name on your ticket matches your travel documents exactly — especially if you’re flying internationally. .</P> 
<li><h2>CHECK THE WEATHER AT YOUR DISTINATION</h2></li>

<p> You should check the weather forecast at least 5days in advance,
    <br>so you should have no trouble packing for you trip. </p>
    <li><h2>TAKE SURVIVAL KIT WITH YOU</h2></li>

       <ul>
        <li>Dispren/Panadol</li>
        <li>Sanitizer</li>
        <li>Sleep Aid</li>
        <li>Eye Mask</li>
        <li>Small first-aid kit</li>
        <li>Water Bottles</li>
        <li>lighter</li>
       </ul>
<li><h2>CHARGE YOUR CELL PHONES</h2></li>

 <P>Make sure you have charged your cell phones before leaving.
     <br>In this way if you forget your adapter, you’ll have plenty of battery.
     <br>Or if your mode of transportation doesn’t have entertainment, you can easily<br>
      read or watch a movie on your device.</P>
<li><h2>GET CHECKUP</h2></li>
<img src="image11.jpg" hight=400 width=400>
<P>It’s always a good idea to visit your doctor before taking a trip to make sure you have any prescriptions
<br>you need up to date and filled and to discuss any other medical measures that need to be taken.
<br>Depending on what country you are going to, you may also want to get certain vaccinations.</P>
<li><h2>ALWAYS CARRY SOME MONEY</h2></li>

<P>IN this way, if your ATM card doesn’t work, you can use your cash and also
<br>you can exchange your money into the local currency.It’s also a good idea to
<br>carry a bit of the local currency with you in case you go to a restaurant or
<br>shop that doesn’t accept credit cards.</P>
<li><h2>RESEARCH ON PLACE</h2></li>

<P>When traveling, research can significantly impact your time for the better.
    <br> Researching prior to setting off can give you deep insights into the area,
    <br> telling you places to avoid and places you must go as well an endless amount
    <br>of additional information which will aid your journey.</P>
<li><h2>TAKE DRY EDIBLE ITEMS</h2></li>
<img src="image14.JPG" HIGHT=400 WIDTH=400>
<P>we should take some meal with us that can live longer its good because sometimes
<br> we don’t like the other countries foods And somtimes we are hungry
<br> but cant find any shop near.</P>
